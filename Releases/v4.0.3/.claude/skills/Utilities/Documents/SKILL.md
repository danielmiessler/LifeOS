## 📋 Document Processing Principles

### DOCX Best Practices
1. **Tracked Changes** - Use redlining workflow for professional document review
2. **Minimal Edits** - Only mark text that actually changes, preserve original RSIDs
3. **Batch Changes** - Group related edits (3-10 changes) for efficient processing
4. **Verification** - Always convert to markdown to verify changes applied correctly

### PDF Best Practices
1. **Library Selection** - pypdf for basic ops, pdfplumber for text/tables, reportlab for creation
2. **OCR for Scanned** - Use pytesseract + pdf2image for scanned documents
3. **Form Filling** - Follow forms.md for programmatic form completion
4. **Command Line** - Use qpdf/pdftotext for simple operations

### PPTX Best Practices
1. **Design First** - Analyze content and choose appropriate colors/layouts before coding
2. **Web-Safe Fonts** - Only use web-safe fonts (Arial, Helvetica, Times, etc.)
3. **Visual Verification** - Always generate thumbnails to inspect layout issues
4. **Template Analysis** - Create inventory before using templates to understand structure

### XLSX Best Practices
1. **Use Formulas** - ALWAYS use Excel formulas, NEVER hardcode calculated values
2. **Zero Errors** - Deliver with zero formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)
3. **Recalculate** - Run recalc.py after creating/editing to update formula values
4. **Financial Standards** - Follow color coding (blue inputs, black formulas, green links)

## Examples

**Example 1: Create proposal with tracked changes**
```
User: "Create a consulting proposal doc with redlining"
→ Routes to DOCX workflows
→ Creates document with docx-js
→ Enables tracked changes for review workflow
→ Outputs professional .docx with revision marks
```

**Example 2: Fill a PDF form programmatically**
```
User: "Fill out this NDA PDF with my info"
→ Routes to PDF workflows
→ Reads form fields from PDF
→ Fills fields programmatically with pdf-lib
→ Outputs completed, flattened PDF
```

**Example 3: Build financial model spreadsheet**
```
User: "Create a revenue projection spreadsheet"
→ Routes to XLSX workflows
→ Creates workbook with openpyxl
→ Adds formulas (never hardcoded values)
→ Runs recalc.py to update calculations
```

**Example 4: Generate professional consulting report PDF**
```
User: "Create a consulting report from the assessment data"
→ Routes to ConsultingReport workflow
→ Parses report directory for data files, markdown, diagrams
→ Compresses images (PNG→JPEG, max 1200px)
→ Generates styled HTML with professional typography
→ Converts to PDF via Playwright with headers/footers
→ Outputs McKinsey-quality A4 PDF with TOC, diagrams, color boxes
```
