# The Notification System

**Notifications for PAI workflows and task execution.**

> **Infrastructure:** The notification endpoint (`http://localhost:31337/notify`) is served by the unified Pulse daemon (`~/.claude/PAI/PULSE/`). One daemon, one port, one launchd plist (`com.pai.pulse`).

This system provides:
- Text and desktop feedback when workflows start
- Consistent user experience across all skills

---

## Task Start Announcements

**When STARTING a task, output a text notification:**

```
[Doing what {PRINCIPAL.NAME} asked]...
```

**Skip announcements for conversational responses** (greetings, acknowledgments, simple Q&A).

---

## Context-Aware Announcements

**Match your announcement to what {PRINCIPAL.NAME} asked.** Start with the appropriate gerund:

| {PRINCIPAL.NAME}'s Request | Announcement Style |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Question ("Where is...", "What does...") | "Checking...", "Looking up...", "Finding..." |
| Command ("Fix this", "Create that") | "Fixing...", "Creating...", "Updating..." |
| Investigation ("Why isn't...", "Debug this") | "Investigating...", "Debugging...", "Analyzing..." |
| Research ("Find out about...", "Look into...") | "Researching...", "Exploring...", "Looking into..." |

**Examples:**
- "Where's the config file?" → "Checking the project for config files..."
- "Fix this bug" → "Fixing the null pointer in auth handler..."
- "Why isn't the API responding?" → "Investigating the API connection..."
- "Create a new component" → "Creating the new component..."

---

## Workflow Invocation Notifications

**For skills with `Workflows/` directories, use "Executing..." format:**

```
Executing the **WorkflowName** workflow within the **SkillName** skill...
```

**Examples:**
- "Executing the **GIT** workflow within the **CORE** skill..."
- "Executing the **Publish** workflow within the **Blogging** skill..."

**NEVER announce fake workflows:**
- "Executing the file organization workflow..." - NO SUCH WORKFLOW EXISTS
- If it's not listed in a skill's Workflow Routing, DON'T use "Executing" format
- For non-workflow tasks, use context-appropriate gerund

### Phase Tracking via `/notify`

When following the Algorithm template, a `curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify` call can carry phase metadata to drive terminal-tab and session state:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the SKILLNAME skill to ACTION", "title": "{DA_IDENTITY.NAME}"}' \
  > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

**Parameters:**
- `message` - The notification text (workflow and skill name)
- `title` - Display name for the notification
- `phase` (optional, 2026-04-16+) - Uppercase Algorithm phase (`OBSERVE`, `THINK`, `PLAN`, `BUILD`, `EXECUTE`, `VERIFY`, `LEARN`, `COMPLETE`). When present, triggers dual-source phase tracking — the endpoint (a) appends a `phaseHistory` entry with `source: "notify"`, (b) updates top-level `session.phase` (lowercase), and (c) calls `setPhaseTab(phase, sessionUUID)` to update the terminal tab icon/color. All three fire together so the UI never goes stale between ISA edits.
- `slug` (optional, 2026-04-16+) - The ISA session slug. Used to route the phase write to the correct session. When absent, falls back to most-recently-updated non-complete session within 2-hour window.

**Dual-source phase tracking:** `/notify` is the first-fires/always-fires signal for Algorithm phase transitions. ISASync hook is the rich-but-sometimes-skipped signal from ISA frontmatter edits. Both feed `phaseHistory` via `hooks/lib/isa-utils.ts::appendPhase()` — same phase + different source = upgrade to `source: "merged"`. **Both also write top-level `session.phase` and call `setPhaseTab()`.** See `PAI/MEMORY/KNOWLEDGE/Ideas/dual-source-event-tracking-pattern.md`.

## When to Skip Notifications

**Always skip notifications when:**
- **Conversational responses** - Greetings, acknowledgments, simple Q&A
- **Skill has no workflows** - The skill has no `Workflows/` directory
- **Direct skill handling** - SKILL.md handles request without invoking a workflow file
- **Quick utility operations** - Simple file reads, status checks
- **Sub-workflows** - When a workflow calls another workflow (avoid double notification)

**The rule:** Only notify when actually loading and following a `.md` file from a `Workflows/` directory, or when starting significant task work.

## External Notifications (Push, Discord)

**Beyond local desktop notifications, PAI supports external notification channels:**

### Available Channels

| Channel | Service | Purpose | Configuration |
|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **ntfy** | ntfy.sh | Mobile push notifications | `settings.json → notifications.ntfy` |
| **Discord** | Webhook | Team/server notifications | `settings.json → notifications.discord` |
| **Desktop** | macOS native | Local desktop alerts | Always available |

### Smart Routing

Notifications are automatically routed based on event type:

| Event | Default Channels | Trigger |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| `taskComplete` | Desktop only | Normal task completion |
| `longTask` | Desktop + ntfy | Task duration > 5 minutes |
| `backgroundAgent` | ntfy | Background agent completes |
| `error` | Desktop + ntfy | Error in response |
| `security` | Desktop + ntfy + Discord | Security alert |

### Configuration

Located in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "ntfy": {
      "enabled": true,
      "topic": "pai-[random-topic]",
      "server": "ntfy.sh"
    },
    "discord": {
      "enabled": false,
      "webhook": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
    },
    "thresholds": {
      "longTaskMinutes": 5
    },
    "routing": {
      "taskComplete": [],
      "longTask": ["ntfy"],
      "backgroundAgent": ["ntfy"],
      "error": ["ntfy"],
      "security": ["ntfy", "discord"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ntfy.sh Setup

1. **Generate topic**: `echo "pai-$(openssl rand -hex 8)"` _(topic is effectively a shared secret — anyone who knows it can read your notifications, so keep it unpredictable)_
2. **Install app**: iOS App Store or Android Play Store → "ntfy"
3. **Subscribe**: Add your topic in the app
4. **Test**: `curl -d "Test" ntfy.sh/your-topic`

Topic name acts as password - use random string for security.

### Discord Setup

1. Create webhook in your Discord server
2. Add webhook URL to `settings.json`
3. Set `discord.enabled: true`

### SMS (Not Recommended)

**SMS is impractical for personal notifications.** US carriers require A2P 10DLC campaign registration since Dec 2024, which involves:
- Brand registration + verification (weeks)
- Campaign approval + monthly fees
- Carrier bureaucracy for each number

**Alternatives researched (Jan 2025):**

| Option | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **ntfy.sh** | ✅ RECOMMENDED | Same result (phone alert), zero hassle |
| **Textbelt** | ❌ Blocked | Free tier disabled for US due to abuse |
| **AppleScript + Messages.app** | ⚠️ Requires permissions | Works if you grant automation access |
| **Twilio Toll-Free** | ⚠️ Simpler | 5-14 day verification (vs 3-5 weeks for 10DLC) |
| **Email-to-SMS** | ⚠️ Carrier-dependent | `number@vtext.com` (Verizon), `@txt.att.net` (AT&T) |

**Bottom line:** ntfy.sh already alerts your phone. SMS adds carrier bureaucracy for the same outcome.

### Implementation

The notification service is in `~/.claude/hooks/lib/notifications.ts`:

```typescript
import { notify, notifyTaskComplete, notifyBackgroundAgent, notifyError } from './lib/notifications';

// Smart routing based on task duration
await notifyTaskComplete("Task completed successfully");

// Explicit background agent notification
await notifyBackgroundAgent("Researcher", "Found 5 relevant articles");

// Error notification
await notifyError("Database connection failed");

// Direct channel access
await sendPush("Message", { title: "Title", priority: "high" });
await sendDiscord("Message", { title: "Title", color: 0x00ff00 });
```

## Event Log Channel (events.jsonl)


Events are emitted via `~/.claude/hooks/lib/observability-transport.ts`, which is synchronous and fire-and-forget. This channel is additive -- it does not replace any of the notification channels above, and hooks emit events alongside their existing state writes and notifications.

---

### Design Principles

1. **Fire and forget** - Notifications never block hook execution
2. **Fail gracefully** - Missing services don't cause errors
3. **Conservative defaults** - Avoid notification fatigue
4. **Duration-aware** - Only push for long-running tasks (>5 min)
